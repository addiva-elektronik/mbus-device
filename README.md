Basic M-Bus Device
==================

This project provides a very basic M-Bus end-device to act as a 'slave'
role in a wired M-Bus network.  It builds on [libmbus][1] and provides
enough functionality to:

 - Respond to requests
 - Respond to primary address scanning
 - Respond to secondary address scanning
 - Set primary address from secondary address

> **Note:** this slave role device is only used for testing a master.


Example
-------

You can use `socat` on a Linux system to emulate a point-to-point serial
connection.  On one side of the connection you run the `mbus-device` and
on the other side you can play around with the various libmbus tools.

In terminal A, run `socat` (as a regular user), take note of the devices
created, `/dev/pts/NUM`, here we have 12 + 13:

    $ socat -d -d pty,rawer pty,rawer
    2022/09/26 08:46:54 socat[528933] N PTY is /dev/pts/12
    2022/09/26 08:46:54 socat[528933] N PTY is /dev/pts/13
    2022/09/26 08:46:54 socat[528933] N starting data transfer loop with FDs [5,5] and [7,7]

In terminal B, start the `mbus-device`, here we use primary address 5:

    $ mbus-device -a 5 /dev/pts/12

In terminal C, start a libmbus tool, here we request data:

    $ mbus-serial-request-data /dev/pts/13 5

Build & Install
---------------

First install [libmbus][1], using the defaults it gets installed into
`/usr/local`.  Debian/Ubuntu systems support that path out of the box,
but Fedora/RedHat systems may need some special incantations.  The
installed library provides a `libmbus.pc` file, which this project use
to figure out the path to the library and include files.

Issuing

    make

builds `mbus-device` in the current directory.  Install it anywhere on
your system, and make sure to bundle the library .so file if you move
the binary to another system.
